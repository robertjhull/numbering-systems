This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This is a small app built for practicing the conversion of integers between **binary**, **base 10**, **base 8**, and **base 16**.

This app is a WIP.

## Dev Plan

The following features are planned:

- [] _Choose between any type of base_.
- [] _Choose the number of questions displayed per page_.
- [] _Show the correct answers if the user answer is wrong_.
- [] _Explanations on converting between bases_.

Other potential features:

- _Hex color practice?_
