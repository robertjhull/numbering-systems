This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This is a small app built for practicing the conversion of integers between **binary**, **decimal**, **octal**, and **hexadecimal**.

This app is a WIP.

## Features

The app will first display a page asking the user how many questions they would like to solve, the maximum range of numbers, and types of conversions to be tested on.

Implemented features:

- [x] Select the type of conversions to be tested.
- [x] Choose the number of questions per quiz.
- [x] Animated progress bar.
- [x] Show the correct answers if the user answer is wrong.
- [ ] Explanations on converting between bases.
- [ ] Allow user to change themes.

Other potential features:

- Hex color practice?
- Algebraic operations on numbers (e.g. _What is Ob110010 * 0x8D or _What is 35 - 026?_)?
- Unusual bases? (quaternary, pentoctogesimal, etc.)

## Tools Used

- NextJS 10.0.6
