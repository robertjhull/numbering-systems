This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This is a small app built for practicing the conversion of integers between **binary**, **base 10**, **base 8**, and **base 16**.

This app is a WIP.

## Features

The app will first display a page asking the user how many questions they would like to solve, along with selected the types of bases to be tested on. For example, you could select 10 questions covering conversion only between decimal numbers to binary.

Implemented features:

- [ ] Select the type of conversions to be tested.
- [ ] Choose the number of questions per quiz.
- [ ] Animated progress bar.
- [ ] Show the correct answers if the user answer is wrong.
- [ ] Explanations on converting between bases.
- [ ] Allow user to change themes.

Other potential features:

- Hex color practice?
- Algebraic operations on numbers (e.g. _What is 110010\_2 * 8D\_16?_ or _What is 35 - 26\_8?_)?

## Tools Used
