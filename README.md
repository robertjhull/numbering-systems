This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The app tests your knowledge on converting numbers between **binary**, **decimal**, **octal**, and **hexadecimal** numbering systems.

## Pages

`/`
- The starting page where users can select the parameters to be tested on (question amount, decimal range, and types of bases).

`/about`
- Page detailing all the features of the app.

`/quiz`
- The quiz takes the list of generated numbers and questions the user on randomly selected conversion types for each number. The progress bar shows the percentage progress and flashes red or green depending on whether the answer is correct.

`/quiz/results`
- Here you can see the full list of questions as well as your own answers compared to the correct ones.
